# Sales Project - NTI

## Description
This project contains sales data (Sales Data) collected and analyzed as part of a training or practical project with NTI (National Telecommunications Institute). The data includes detailed information on orders, customers, products, and revenue across different regions, segments, and categories. The main file is "Sales Project-NTI.xlsx," which can be used for creating reports, dashboards, or analyses using tools like Power BI or Excel.

## Project Contents
- **Sales Project-NTI.xlsx**: An Excel file containing the following columns:
  - Order ID
  - Order Date and Ship Date
  - Ship Mode
  - Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office), Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region
  - Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
  - Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit

Additionally, the repository includes summarized data such as quarterly sales, regional performance, and sub-category analysis, which can be found in the Excel file or derived using analysis tools.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze sales performance to understand trends, regional contributions, segment profitability, and product category effectiveness. It aims to help identify high-performing regions (e.g., Central, East, South, West), top-selling products, and areas for improvement. The data can be used to build interactive dashboards or reports for strategic decision-making.

## How to Use the Data
1. Download the "Sales Project-NTI.xlsx" file from this repository.
2. Open the file using Microsoft Excel or a data analysis tool such as Power BI.
3. Use the columns to perform analyses, create visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs), or build dashboards. For example:
   - Analyze sales by region, segment, or sub-category.
   - Track quarterly or yearly trends in sales and profit.
   - Identify the top-performing products or segments.
4. If using Power BI, import the data and create measures or visuals to explore metrics like total sales, profit margins, or regional contributions.
